A Computer, in JavaScript
=========================
Think of it as a little brother to Fabrice Bellardâ€™s [Javascript PC Emulator](http://bellard.org/jslinux/) but it runs on AVR, rather than Intel x86. It more-closely related to the [TRS-80 emulator] (http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~pphillip/trs80.html) of Peter Phillips.

The code is written in [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/); but since it is running on `-watch`, it results in up-to-date JavaScript as well.
It is being tested on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) in development; how would the heavily-used `Buffer` class work on a browser?
