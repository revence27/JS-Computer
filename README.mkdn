A Computer, in JavaScript
=========================
Think of it as a little brother to Fabrice Bellard’s [Javascript PC Emulator](http://bellard.org/jslinux/) but it runs on AVR, rather than Intel x86, and it is a new machine, rather than an emulation of a pre-existing machine. There are many other inspirational projects in this vein, to which this one is more-closely related (see footnotes). 

The code is written in [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/); but since it is running on `--watch`, it results in up-to-date JavaScript as well.
It is being tested on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) in development; how would the heavily-used `Buffer` class work on a browser?
